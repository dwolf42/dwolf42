# üëã Hey there, I'm David! It's great to see you checking out my profile.

Since December 2019, I have been passionately studying **Java** at the JetBrains Academy [Hyperskill.org](https://hyperskill.org) in my spare time. My enthusiasm for IT led me to embark on a new career path by planning to undergo a vocational training as an IT specialist for application development.

  </summary>
When I first joined Hyperskill, I felt overwhelmed by the challenges. Often problems seemed impossible to solve with my limited knowledge.
<br>
But I quickly learned that Hyperskill's approach was beneficial: it wasn't about hand-holding like other academies, but rather encouraging me to explore, research, and test different solutions independently.
<br>
Which essentially means to come up with my very own ideas of code.
<br>
<br>
Over time, I came to understand that being a software developer is all about problem-solving, regardless of the language or syntax being.
<br>
It's about finding answers to tasks that initially seem impossible.
<br>
Although I felt overwhelmed at first, I saw significant improvements in my coding and problem-solving skills throughout the process. And I achieved all this with only little prior knowledge.
<br>
<br>
Code to me is not just about getting the answer right. The satisfaction and joy of the "Eureka" moment when I finally solve a problem on my own is something I wouldn't want to miss in my life anymore.
<br>
<br>
That's why I stuck with Hyperskill, trading a quick progression through the fundamentals and quickly reaching an advanced level for what I believe is a deeper understanding of the concepts.

## üöÄ Projects

### [TicTacToeSuperGT üïπÔ∏è (non-OOP, completed)](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT)

This project incorporates all the knowledge I gained from the "Simple TicTacToe" course at JetBrains Academy on [Hyperskill.org](https://www.hyperskill.org). I expanded on the basic course version and created a stand-alone program with an installer for Windows, which also contains all required Java files. The game boasts several cool features like ASCII art, pause & clear screen feature, tutorial, winner/tie display, input safety, welcome screen, and credits. 
Feel free to [play my game](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT/releases/tag/v1.0)!  
Dive into the source [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT).

### [Java Tutorials üìö](https://github.com/dwolf42/java-tutorials)

I really enjoy writing tutorials to explain how things work. One day, I found that it was easier for me to understand and remember complex ideas when I explained them to myself in simple tutorials. This is the basic idea on which I started my Java Tutorials project.
With a very pictorial language and many comparisons, I describe for example the basic principles behind a nested for-loop, how I remember the difference between Stack and Heap memory, or my understanding of how return value methods work.
I also wrote a guide on how to turn Java code into an .exe file that can run on Windows. This guide includes how to create an installer, which ships all the needed Java files. As a bonus, I show how to make custom icons for the installer and the .exe file, so they have a really personal touch.<br>

### [Java Courses üë®‚Äçüè´](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses)

All of my active and completed JetBrains Academy projects, as well as my side projects and experimentational work.
Everything is neatly arranged by topic in a single repository, so it is easier to bowse for certain topics.
<br>
Enjoy exploring it [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses).

### [RPG üßô (OOP, in development)](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/off_course_projects/rpg)

A project completely off-course. Nothing I can relate on.
I started this project to improve my OOP skills by developing something I have a deep connection to and a lot of passion for.
RPGs have always fascinated me. I like to discover new things and foreign worlds, with a bag full of healing potions and a sword, kicking the crap out of dragons, zombies and bats, going on adventures, gaining experience and picking up a golden coin or two along the way.
That's my current plan for the project, and I'm really looking forward to shape and expand the RPG.<br>
Have a [look](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/off_course_projects/rpg).

### [Coffee Machine ‚òï (OOP, completed)](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_coffee_machine/final_stage)

My first experiences with self-crated classes, objects, enums, and packages in Java. It is also my latest achievement on my coding journey.
Object orientation is a very exciting field in software development for me, to structure code much better than it is possible purely with methods. I'm really looking forward to dive further into this area and getting a better understanding of the countless possibilities object-oriented programming offers.
<br>
You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_coffee_machine/final_stage).

### [Bulls and Cows üêÆ (currently non-OOP, in development)](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_bulls_and_cows)

Bulls and Cows is the latest course project I started, after which I will receive my certification about my knowledge in Java fundamentals.
Here I write my own advanced version of this classic code breaking game by recreating the original version of it and take the game to a new level.<br>
Curious? [Click me](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_bulls_and_cows).
