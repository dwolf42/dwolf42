# üëã Hey there, I'm David! It's great to see you checking out my profile.

Since December 2019, I have been passionately studying **Java** at the JetBrains Academy [Hyperskill.org](https://hyperskill.org) in my spare time. I am passionate about IT and started to pursue my career as an IT specialist for application development through vocational training in September 2023.

When I first joined Hyperskill, I felt overwhelmed by the challenges. Problems often seemed impossible to solve with my limited knowledge.
<br>
However, I quickly learned that Hyperskill's approach was beneficial. They encouraged me to explore, research, and test different solutions independently instead of hand-holding like other academies.
<br>
Which essentially means to come up with my very own ideas of code.
<br>
<br>
Over time, I came to understand that being a software developer is all about problem-solving, regardless of the language or syntax.
<br>
It's about finding answers to tasks that initially seem impossible.
<br>
Since then, I made significant improvements in my coding and problem-solving skills throughout the process. I achieved this with only little prior knowledge.
<br>
<br>
Coding to me is not just about getting the answer right. The satisfaction and joy of the "Eureka" moment when I finally solve a problem on my own is something I wouldn't want to miss in my life anymore.
<br>
<br>
That's why I chose to stick with Hyperskill. I traded quick progression through the fundamentals for a deeper understanding of the concepts, which I believe is more valuable.

## üöÄ Projects

### [TicTacToeSuperGT üïπÔ∏è (non-OOP, completed)](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT)

I used the knowledge gained from the 'Simple TicTacToe' course at JetBrains Academy on [Hyperskill.org](https://www.hyperskill.org) to create a standalone program for Windows. The program includes all required Java files and features ASCII art, a pause and clear screen function, a tutorial, a winner/tie display, input safety, a welcome screen, and credits. 
Feel free to [play my game](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT/releases/tag/v1.0)!  
Dive into the source [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT).

### [Java Tutorials üìö](https://github.com/dwolf42/java-tutorials)

I enjoy writing tutorials that explain how things work.  I started my Java Tutorials project based on the idea that it's easier to understand and remember complex ideas when explained in simple tutorials.
I use simple language to explain basic programming concepts, such as nested for-loops, Stack and Heap memory, and return value methods.
Additionally, I provide a guide on how to create an .exe file for Windows, including instructions on creating an installer that includes all necessary Java files. As a bonus, I will demonstrate how to create custom icons for the installer and the .exe file, giving them a personal touch.<br>

### [Java Courses üë®‚Äçüè´](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses)

All of my completed and ongoing projects from JetBrains Academy, as well as my side projects and experimental work, are neatly organized by topic in a single repository.
This makes it easier to browse for specific topics.
<br>
Enjoy exploring it [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses).

### [RPG üßô (OOP, in development)](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/off_course_projects/rpg)

A project completely off course. Nothing I can relate to.
I started this project to improve my OOP skills by developing something I have a deep connection to and a lot of passion for.
RPGs have always fascinated me. I like discovering new things and foreign worlds, with a bag full of healing potions and a sword, kicking the crap out of dragons, zombies and bats, going on adventures, gaining experience and picking up a golden coin or two along the way.
That's my current plan for the project, and I'm really looking forward to shaping and expanding the RPG.<br>
Have a [look](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/off_course_projects/rpg).

### [Coffee Machine ‚òï (OOP, completed)](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_coffee_machine/final_stage)

My first experience with self-created classes, objects, enums and packages in Java. It is also my latest achievement on my coding journey.
Object orientation is a very exciting area of software development for me, to structure code much better than it is possible with pure methods. I'm really looking forward to diving further into this area and getting a better understanding of the countless possibilities that object-oriented programming offers.
<br>
You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_coffee_machine/final_stage).

### [Bulls and Cows üêÆ (currently non-OOP, in development)](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_bulls_and_cows)

Bulls and Cows is the last course project I started to get my certification in Java basics.
Here I am writing my own advanced version of this classic code-breaking game by recreating the original version and taking the game to a new level.<br>
Curious? [Click me](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_bulls_and_cows).
