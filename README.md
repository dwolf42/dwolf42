Hello, my name is David.
I'm from Germany, and I'm happy to welcome you on my profile!

Since December 2019, I have been studying with extraordinary passion in Java at JetBrains Academy after work and in my spare time. Following the project-driven courses, I learn the language's basics and work towards a certificate.

Through coding, my research, and documentation, as well as my self-written tutorials, my already very strong enthusiasm and passion for IT in general became much greater. That's why I decided to take a new path by doing a second vocational training as an IT specialist for application development.

Please allow me, to present my most important projects and give an overview of what I have already taught myself.

In my TicTacToeSuperGT project, I incorporated all the knowledge and components I learned from the hands-on "Simple TicTacToe" course at JetBrains Academy on [Hyperskill.org](https://www.hyperskill.org).
The course it self can be found here: [Simple-TicTacToe](https://hyperskill.org/projects/48?track=8)
My TicTacToe course version: [TicTacToe-EDU](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToe-EDU/blob/88e3d23e624d2027ddb79b41025ae3a9e0b96351/Simple%20Tic-Tac-Toe/task/src/tictactoe/Main.java)

To learn the underleying mechanics of such a program, the course version is kept rather simple. The game consists only of a frame, inside which the players take turns to enter their moves.
As you may see on the screenshot, there are no indicators for to represent rows or columns.

A proper introduction about to how to play the game is also missing. In addition to this, I really missed an easy way to share my game with friends without them or me having much of an effort.

Right at the beginning of the "Simple TicTacToe" course, I wrote [TicTacToeSuper](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuper) as a self-developed spin-off from the project. The inspriration for it came from a great [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/L3-q2GxAqZA) by Alex Lee, in which he describes the concept of two-dimensional arrays using a lottery card in a very comprehensible way.

It was the basis on which I developed [TicTacToeSuperGT](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT), which has the following features:

Stand-alone version:
TicTacToeSuperGT comes with an installer for Windows, which installs the game. This includes all the necessary Java files to be playable, which allowed my friends to play it regardless of the presence of a Java version on their PC. For the icons of each the installer and the desktop shortcut, I made the design myself. Upon installation, the user nay choose a path for the game, as well as the installer comes with an option to uninstall.
You may try it out yourself [TicTacToeSuperGT releases v1.0](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT/releases/tag/v1.0)!

ASCII Art:
Gameplay experience and fun is super important in my opinion, so I included some appealing and dynamic ASCII Art in my game.
I broke the graphical art down into 5 parts, which come back together perfectly to fit into the overall experience while the game is running. 
> These parts are:
> - The upper part of the castle, containing column indicators and the upper part of the knight: There are three dynamically changing graphics of part (see below).
> - The left part of the castle, having row indicators.
> - The playing field, consisting of a 3x3 array.
> - The right part of the castle, containing also the middle part of the rider and his horse.
> - The lower part of the castle, having the remaining part of the rider and his horse.

Pause & Clear Screen:
I developed this system to pause the game for a short moment. The player is thus made aware of certain content and can read it in peace. In addition, the previously displayed content is pushed up in the console to grant a clear screen.

Winner / Tie Display:
The game will display the winner. If all the squares are occupied and no one has won, a draw is output.

Input safety:
In case of wrong coordinates, letters or a blank input, the player is made aware of what input is needed.

Welcome screen:
The player is welcomed and given instructions for a better playing experience.

How to play:
A short tutorial about the gameplay.

Since I wrote my previous projects without object orientation, I would like to draw your attention to my recently finished project "Coffee Machine". Here I made my first experiences with objects in Java. (Code: https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_coffee_machine/final_stage)
In favor of my faster progress through the Java Basics course, at the end of which I will receive a certificate from the JetBrains Academy, I refrained from disassembling the Coffee Machine.
Nevertheless, I think I can map my first knowledge in OOP well with the course version.

In my project "java_courses" I summarize what I am working on at the JetBrains Academy, but also my side projects (repository https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses), clearly arranged and bundled by topics.
