# üëã Hey there, I'm David! It's great to see you checking out my profile.

Since December 2019, I have been passionately studying **Java** at JetBrains Academy in my spare time. My enthusiasm for IT led me to embark on a new path by planning to undergoing vocational training as an IT specialist for application development.

## üöÄ Projects

### Coffee Machine (OOP) ‚òï

My first experiences with self-crated classes, objects, enums, and packages in Java. It is also my latest achievement on my coding journey.
Object orientation is a very exciting field in software development for me, to structure code much better than it is possible purely with methods. I'm really looking forward to diving further into this area and getting a better understanding of the many possibilities that objects offer.

You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_coffee_machine/final_stage).

### TicTacToeSuperGT (non-OOP) üïπÔ∏è

This project incorporates all the knowledge I gained from the "Simple TicTacToe" course at JetBrains Academy on [Hyperskill.org](https://www.hyperskill.org). I expanded on the basic course version and created a stand-alone program with an installer for Windows, which also contains all required Java files. The game boasts several cool features like ASCII art, pause & clear screen feature, tutorial, winner/tie display, input safety, welcome screen, and credits. 
Feel free to [try out my game](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT/releases/tag/v1.0)!  
My code can be found [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT).

### Bulls and Cows üêÆ

Bulls and Cows is my latest project, after which I will receive my certification about my knowledge in Java fundamentals.
Here I write my own advanced version of this classic code breaking game by recreating the original version of it and take the game to a new level.<br>

### Java Tutorials üìö

I really enjoy writing tutorials to explain how things work. One day, I found that it was easier for me to understand and remember complex ideas when I explained them to myself in simple tutorials. This is the basic idea on which I started my Java Tutorials project.
With a very pictorial language and many comparisons, I describe for example the basic principles behind a nested for-loop, how I remember the difference between Stack and Heap memory, or my understanding of how return value methods work.
I also have a guide that shows how to turn Java code into a ```.exe``` file that can run on Windows. The guide includes how to create an installer, which brings all the needed Java files and helps to make the installer and .exe file look nice with cool icons.<br>

### Java Courses ü§ì

All of my active and completed JetBrains Academy projects, as well my side projects and experimentational things. All neatly arranged by topic in a single repository, so it is easier for me and others to look for examples on certain topics.
