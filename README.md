# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm David, and happy to have you visiting my profile!

Since December 2019, I have been passionately studying **Java** at JetBrains Academy in my spare time. My enthusiasm for IT led me to embark on a new path by undergoing vocational training as an IT specialist for application development.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### TicTacToeSuperGT (non-OOP)

This project incorporates all the knowledge I gained from the "Simple TicTacToe" course at JetBrains Academy on [Hyperskill.org](https://www.hyperskill.org). I expanded on the basic course version and created a stand-alone program with an installer for Windows, which also contains all required Java files. The game boasts several cool features like ASCII art, pause & clear screen feature, tutorial, winner/tie display, input safety, welcome screen, and credits. Feel free to try it out [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT/releases/tag/v1.0)!

### Coffee Machine (OOP)

This project stands as the latest achievement in my coding journey, and marked my first experience with objects in Java. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_coffee_machine/final_stage).

### Java Tutorials
I really enjoy writing tutorials to explain how things work. One day, I found that it was easier for me to understand and remember complex ideas when I explained them to myself in simple tutorials. This is the basic idea on which I started my Java Tutorials project.
With a very pictorial language and many comparisons, I describe unconventionally the basic principles behind a nested for-loop, how I remember the difference between Stack and Heap memory, or my understanding of how return value methods work.

I also have a guide that shows how to turn Java code into a ```.exe``` file that can run on Windows. The guide includes how to create an installer, which brings all the needed Java files and helps to make the installer and .exe file look nice with cool icons.
