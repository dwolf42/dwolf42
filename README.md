# üëã Hey there, I'm David! It's great to see you checking out my profile.

Since December 2019, I have been passionately studying **Java** at JetBrains Academy [Hyperskill.org](https://hyperskill.org) in my spare time. My enthusiasm for IT led me to embark on a new path by planning to undergoing vocational training as an IT specialist for application development.

  </summary>
When I first joined Hyperskill, I felt overwhelmed by the challenges. Often problems seemed impossible to solve with my limited knowledge.
<br>
But I quickly learned that Hyperskill's approach was beneficial: it wasn't about hand-holding like other academies, but rather encouraging me to explore, research, and test different solutions independently.
<br>
Which essentially means to come up with my very own ideas of code.
<br>
<br>
Over time, I came to understand that being a software developer is all about problem-solving, regardless of the language or syntax being.
<br>
It's about finding answers to tasks that initially seem impossible.
<br>
Although I felt overwhelmed at first, I saw significant improvements in my coding and problem-solving skills throughout the process. And I achieved all this with only little prior knowledge.
<br>
<br>
It's not just about getting the answer right. The satisfaction and joy of the "Eureka" moment when I finally solve a problem on my own is something I wouldn't want to miss in my life anymore.
<br>
<br>
That's why I stuck with Hyperskill, trading a quick progression through the fundamentals and quickly reaching an advanced level for what I believe is a deeper understanding of the concepts.

## üöÄ Projects

### RPG (OOP) üßô

A project completely off-course. Nothing I can relate on. All the parts of it are made up on my own.
I started this project to improve my OOP skills by developing something I have a deep connection to and a lot of passion for.
RPGs have always fascinated me. I like to discover new things and foreign worlds, with a bag full of healing potions and a sword, kicking the crap out of dragons, zombies and bats, going on adventures, gaining experience and picking up a golden coin or two along the way.
That's my current plan for the project, and I'm really looking forward to shaping and expanding the RPG.<br>
Have a [look](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/off_course_projects/rpg).

### Coffee Machine (OOP) ‚òï

My first experiences with self-crated classes, objects, enums, and packages in Java. It is also my latest achievement on my coding journey.
Object orientation is a very exciting field in software development for me, to structure code much better than it is possible purely with methods. I'm really looking forward to diving further into this area and getting a better understanding of the many possibilities that objects offer.
<br>
You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_coffee_machine/final_stage).

### TicTacToeSuperGT (non-OOP) üïπÔ∏è

This project incorporates all the knowledge I gained from the "Simple TicTacToe" course at JetBrains Academy on [Hyperskill.org](https://www.hyperskill.org). I expanded on the basic course version and created a stand-alone program with an installer for Windows, which also contains all required Java files. The game boasts several cool features like ASCII art, pause & clear screen feature, tutorial, winner/tie display, input safety, welcome screen, and credits. 
Feel free to [try out my game](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT/releases/tag/v1.0)!  
My code can be found [here](https://github.com/dwolf42/TicTacToeSuperGT).

### Bulls and Cows üêÆ

Bulls and Cows is my latest course project, after which I will receive my certification about my knowledge in Java fundamentals.
Here I write my own advanced version of this classic code breaking game by recreating the original version of it and take the game to a new level.<br>
Please see my code [click](https://github.com/dwolf42/java_courses/tree/master/src/dwolf/project_bulls_and_cows).

### Java Tutorials üìö

I really enjoy writing tutorials to explain how things work. One day, I found that it was easier for me to understand and remember complex ideas when I explained them to myself in simple tutorials. This is the basic idea on which I started my Java Tutorials project.
With a very pictorial language and many comparisons, I describe for example the basic principles behind a nested for-loop, how I remember the difference between Stack and Heap memory, or my understanding of how return value methods work.
I also have a guide that shows how to turn Java code into a ```.exe``` file that can run on Windows. The guide includes how to create an installer, which brings all the needed Java files and helps to make the installer and .exe file look nice with cool icons.<br>

### Java Courses üë®‚Äçüè´

All of my active and completed JetBrains Academy projects, as well as my side projects and experimentational work. All neatly arranged by topic in a single repository, so it is easier for me and others to look for examples on certain topics.
